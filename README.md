#Final project 

-- TITLE OF PROJECT --
TheBookList

-- DESCRIPTION --

For the final project I created a website where users can search for different types of books with the help of a open library API, and gather information for books. As an avid reader, the user can post a review of a book of their choice, and the review will be displayed for other users to read.

-- FEATURES --

Search bar: Through the search bar, the user an type either a book title, or a name of an author, and the website will show results based on the input. 

Filtering/sorting: It is possible to filter the search results, either by author, title, by alphabetical order, or by recent/oldest.

Review form: The user can write a small review of their book of choice.

Log in/sign up: The user can create an account, and their account will be saved through Firebase Authentification.

-- INSTALLATION --

-HTML
-CSS
-JS 

This project has installed webpack, babel and webpack-cli, and has initialized firebase for authentification of users and for firestore.
